## üìù Notes and Considerations

### Development Best Practices
- Use semantic HTML5 elements for better accessibility
- Implement progressive enhancement (works without JavaScript)
- Use CSS custom properties for maintainable styling
- Comment complex calculations with formula explanations
- Test with real-world property scenarios

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid
- Don't forget to handle division by zero in calculations
- Ensure proper decimal precision for financial calculations
- Test with extreme values (very high/low property prices)
- Validate that percentage inputs are reasonable
- Consider leap years in long-term calculations

### Testing Scenarios
- Typical rental property ($200K purchase, 20% down, 6% interest)
- High-end property ($1M+, luxury market conditions)
- Low-cost property ($50K, cash purchase scenario)
- Negative cash flow scenario (expenses > income)
- Zero down payment (investor financing)
